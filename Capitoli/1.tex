As first step, we choose the tail current of the first stage of XXX uA, in order to comply with CMRR requirement.
Then, we choose the overdrive voltage of the NMOS of the second stage, in order to have a 1 kHz noise corner frequency, using the following equation:



Finally, we choose the W/L of the tail transistor to be 10u/25u, so that the slew rate was higher than the requested one.
According to our knowledge, output transistor are too narrow, but we couldnâ€™t find a better solution.
At the end, we were able to build an amplifier with a GBWP of 40 MHz, with a 60 deg phase margin, that consumes XXX uA.
