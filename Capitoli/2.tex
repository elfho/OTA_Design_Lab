Since we were asked to reduce the power consumption, we needed to use a different compensation technique.
As the supply voltage of the OTA is 3 V, the more suitable compensation technique is the feedforward one, as, given a fixed bandwidth, it allows a lower input current noise of the OTA.
We managed to re-design whose frequency response is the same one as the Miller one, with half the current consumption.
